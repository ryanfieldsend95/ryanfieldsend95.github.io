        <h3>Throughout this written report, I will be discussing the key web standards set in place by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and how they have impacted the development of the website. As well as talking about how they made an impact, I will cover why I stuck to the standards when writing the HTML mark-up as well as the CSS stylesheet. Before I cover how the standards affected the development of the site, I will talk about the specifications and standards that are currently in place and how they pose as a challenge when applying them to a website.<br><br>
        Whilst creating your website, it is advantages to stick to the web standards that are in place. These standards are in place to ensure usability is always simple and friendly. This allows other people to use the website with ease and problem free. It also ensures that the website will display in a wide variety of web browsers. This is essential as not everybody uses the same browser and therefore if it doesn’t work in a specific browser, then the users of that browser are penalised and can’t access the site properly. As well as ensuring that the site works in all browsers, it also makes sure that it will work in newer technology such as mobile phones and tablets, vastly increasing the viewing audience of the website.<br><br>
        W3C Standards also push the use of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) with your website development. This is a file that holds the design of the website and is attached the webpage. It reduces the file size of the HTML file giving the page a quicker load time. This also reduces the cost that may be in place to host the website as less bandwidth is being used whilst requests are being made from users. Whilst adhering to the use of CSS, the design of the overall website is made much easier if you decide that you want to change font, colours or sizes etc. This is because editing a CSS sheet will edit the design of all the webpages that are linked to the CSS, giving a much quicker change to any design element to the site.<br><br>
        Web accessibility standards are key when developing as site as it is a legal requirement for businesses to adhere to the laws as their sites must be accessible by people with disabilities. If a business does not follow these rules that are in place, then they can be sued due to discrimination against users with disabilities. This allows people with problems such as mobility and sensory problems a huge benefit by having access to specific sites. A problem in physically going to the shops for people with disabilities is always going to be present as it is generally harder for them to do so than others without disabilities. Websites can give the same problem if they aren’t made in mind with accessibility for disabled people. Specific tags on HTML attributes can give certain levels of accessibility such as an alt tag on images which can be used to give info on what the image may be for visually impaired users.<br><br>
        I believe that current web standards are essential and perform a great role in making sure developers create sites that are available and usable by everyone. Without the standards, I believe that a lot of website would be poorly written and may not work on many of all devices that can be used to access sites. <br><br>
        Whilst developing the website, I made sure that I followed the standards closely and checked them with the validator the make sure I found any errors in my HTML. I wanted to make sure it was accessible through a wider means than just one browser. I made sure it was validated to also work on smaller screens, making sure it had media queries that gave the site functionality on mobile and tablets. It is vital to make your websites accessible on mobile phones and tablets in the current era that we live in. This is because many visits to most websites is through mobile phones and if your site isn’t compatible with these devices then you are restricting your audience.<br><br>
        I also made sure that my file management was understandable as well as neat and tidy. I did this by creating a folder that contained images only, a folder that contained the CSS file only and a folder that holds the JavaScript file only. This makes sure that files can be easily found and edited when necessary.</h3>
